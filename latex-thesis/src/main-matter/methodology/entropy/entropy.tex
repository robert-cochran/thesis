M = ...
a = ..
b = ...
c = ...
window overlap
window size
this may be given in the fast entropy paper

For the initial entropy calculations, work was done on the already existing model parameters to gauge what kind of sensitivity the Fast Entropy technique could work under. The model parameters of M=27, ap = 0.0073, bp = 4.2432, cp = 4.2013 were used in previous experiments, however, only the M was changed (to 9) in order to test the system without building a custom model first. \\
