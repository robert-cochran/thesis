https://media.talkbank.org/dementia would be a good bank to use but its password locked

others are the https://media.talkbank.org/aphasia bank to show that people having difficulty with english or speaking will produce atypical uses of pauses (this is also password protected)

https://media.talkbank.org/childes bank would show children produce an atypical use of pauses, thus being able to differentiate based on age

https://media.talkbank.org/asd (autism spectrum disorder) could show changes in pause use as well 

- Experiment 1.3: Experiment with the types of conversations to analyse
    - Types of conversation

        Where gender is controlled for

        Where age is controlled for

        Where relationship is more controlled for (home vs friend)

        Where language is controlled for

        Eng vs Jpn, Gmn, etc...

    - Reason for experiment

        To derive pause distributions from dialogues of nonspecified gender or age ranges. 

        Lengths are 30minutes on avg.

    - Description of the audio files themselves and resulting properties

        A telephone call from the talk bank where both parties are recorded but no second speaker is included in the analysed audio file to see how a single speaker utilises pauses. 

        The telephone calls range from 10 min to 30 min, range of conversation types (all lighthearted? personal? angry? serious?), range of speaker types (old, young, female, male, etc...)

        - Experiment 1.3.1.1: Single Male Speaker
            - Reason for experiment
                - Reason for experiment:

                    To see how a male (on average?) uses pauses

    - **Problems**
        - 1. Need files with two speakers?
            - How do I collect pauses when I have to split audio file?
                - Do i have to split or can I use regular audio?
        - 2. Histogram not working

    - Constraints
        - This doesn't use two person convo so pauses are abnormally long when other person is speaking
        - This doesn't specify joint or inner pause
        - only taken data from one audio file
    - To Do
        - [ ]  Use 10 second convo (will be faster)
        - [ ]  Or use amazon poly for constructed speech
            - sub tasks
                - this will make the experiment more controlled
                - [x]  5 lines
                - [x]  add in controlled pauses (50ms example then 100ms and see it change)
                - [x]  really good to test validation of algorithm that pauses are all accounted for
                - [x]  show sound file and see the pauses
                - [ ]  say that control is fine but complexities will make it not perfect (dog barking need ot handle those)
                - [ ]  one stage is 8 pauses, nice a good, very clean, synthesise (dead silent)
                - [ ]  next stage, myself? (background noise not dead silent, see if it works, maybe its fine)
                - [ ]  telephone, more noise, less controlled
                - [ ]  ——
                - [ ]  explain why not just what for everything, why we are checking the algo's
        - [ ]  Get hist of two person convo
        - [ ]  Get more bins on hist
        - [ ]  Rank pauses by freq and see if it correlates with ZML
            - Stick with groups of 1ms for rank grouping
    - Contrast

        Could I use the audiofiles from 1.2 and show how they differ in terms of monologue vs dialogue? 

- Experiment 1.4: Experiment with how histogram displays the pause data
    - Change bin widths (non-equal)
    - Change bin counts
        - 2 bin approach
            - Above or below the mean
        - All discrete values as bins on ms level, then maybe 10ms level
    - Bin width change to accommodate for range but also show clarity in smaller pauses
    - What did Janet say about Log histogram? Would that be the same as what I wanted above
    - Small histogram bins are very sensitive to individual data points, becomes less smooth, h bin size is a hyper-parameter (so more sensitive to data in local area, larger bin more smooth and considers data in more area)
- Other Experiments
    - Experiment X: Grab pauses for lower quality audio file

        - None of these were recognised by calpy

- Andrews Notes for layout
    - get the pauses
    - then the stats (for the pauses? what does that mean?)
    - for symbol
    - then entropy
