\subsection{Test 5: Talkbank Waveform Analysis}
	\paragraph{Test:} 
	What the audio waveform looked like in comparison to the results that were returned to identify why talkbank results were so poor. 
	Possible reasons could be:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item{Noise affecting long pauses} 
	\item{poor digitisation} 
		\item interference,
		\item recording quality, 
%		\item someone might put the other on hold, 
		\item they might talk to quietly or too loudly,
		\item one may talk very loud and the other quiet
		\item maybe they talk far too close to the receiver and saturate the audio causing massive spikes in the waveform 
		\item the speakers voices (maybe high voices are better received and thus female audio files have better data
	\end{itemize}

This test involved looking at the audio files themselves and seeing how the waveform varied between files. A high level of variance was present between files, some files show extremely little waveform variance indicating low volume and some show extreme variance indicating flooding of noise. \\
