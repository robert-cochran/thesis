So what does high entropy mean, greater distributed use of the symbols? 

What does high variance mean then? Inconsistent use of pauses. Maybe it was the style of conversation? 

How is it higher variance? Are they hitting higher peaks? Lower troughs? 

What does it tell us about the groups? Maybe the longer length of conv allowed for different use of pauses (relaxed? does that account for the variance?)

This shows the variance tends to be greater for --- conversations, indicating the information theyre giving tends to move from high information to low more frequently whereas -- people tend to stick to a common entropy value more often.

Not only were the outlier points greater for conversations, but I think they tended to fluctuate more often between those points.
