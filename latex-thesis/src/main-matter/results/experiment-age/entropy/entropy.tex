%\paragraph{Overview}

%\paragraph{Andrews notes} You've got a lot of files, and results, but give some 
%careful thought as to how you might perform a statistical test to compare the 
%results obtained and see if there is a difference. 
%
%For example, the most obvious 
%one would be to calculate the statistics, eg say at least mean and variance of the 
%entropy across all the speakers and then see if you can detect any statistically 
%significant differences when you consider male/female. This in itself would be of 
%interest, regardless of the outcome. 
%
%
%
%
%See if I can build a model of general mean of the entropy values and of the variance. \\
%Find two good output files that have very different speech patterns and see if 
%this can be shown to dip or raise entropy in the anomaly plots \\
%
%What are the numbers? Was there only one entorpy value??? Or is that an average? So would this be the parameter for a gaussian of these entropy models?
%
%Would we say thay anything outside of 60\% of 95\% is an outlier then? Maybe we can take the average of all the averages and the average of all the variances and build an classification model with that?

%Where does the ranked probability graph come into it then? Where I'm showing the

%This is the model that was used in the presentation. This was good firstly because it showed the data wasn't uniform or completely predictable, but rather showed levels of predictability, meaning inferences could be made. Secondly it showed the pause distribution to be really similar to the zml curve, such that modelling it with the fast entropy system should be very simple given the already existing similar results from [andrews paper].

\subsection{Experiment 2.2 - Audio Insertion}
Two audio files similar in output quality (i.e. high number of pauses returned) were spliced together to evaluate how well the symbol models do at picking up changes in audio files of different age groups. The JJJ file, jmo-2019-02-26-inspired-ali-barter---girlie-bits, was inserted into the middle of the ABC file, aaj-2019-04-26. The JJJ file was chosen because of the contrast in entropy profile variance and mean between the two files when using the SM[10]. The JJJ podcast had a low variance and high mean while the ABC podcast had a lower mean and higher variance. The contrast between files should make the change easier to spot. The window size: 100 and window over: 99 were used throughout this experiment.
