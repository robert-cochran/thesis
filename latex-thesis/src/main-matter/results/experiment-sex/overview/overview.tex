\subsection{Overview}
This experiment investigated the pause usage of groups based on sex by analysing natural language phone conversations from Talkbank and grouping by who they're speaking with, specifically: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Female only (female to female) 
\item Male only (male to male),
\item Mixed (Female to Male or Male to Female)
\end{enumerate}

%\subsubsection{Aim:}
%The aim of this experiment was to help with developing potential influences when developing symbol sets for larger groups with varying demographics. This experiment will look at the pauses of each group to develop a symbol model. This model will be used to test how the entropy profile behaves, what can be learned from it and if enough distinction between groups allows for classification. We will be testing the classification potential through audio splicing to see if noticeable dips occur in the speech.\\

%In order to create a symbol set that can accurately reflect and shed insight on the data, pauses must be analysed of different groups to see what typical, atypical and outliers look like in the data. Outliers in this section is not referring to outlier behavioural patterns but any files which deliver poor pause digitisation results that might skew analysis later and should be removed to avoid outliers. The main items we are looking for are: \\
