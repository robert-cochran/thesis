%\subsection{Entropy}
%
%
%\paragraph{Overview}
%Look at the mean and variance of the entropy data. compare how they differ 
%between files and what they look like as a whole! See if I can build a model 
%of general mean of the entropy values and of the variance. \\
%
%Find two good output files that have very different speech patterns and see if 
%this can be shown to dip or raise entropy in the anomaly plots \\


%\paragraph{Andrews notes} You've got a lot of files, and results, but give some 
%careful thought as to how you might perform a statistical test to compare the 
%results obtained and see if there is a difference. For example, the most obvious 
%one would be to calculate the statistics, eg say at least mean and variance of the 
%entropy across all the speakers and then see if you can detect any statistically 
%significant differences when you consider male/female. This in itself would be of 
%interest, regardless of the outcome.

%\paragraph{Sex based Probability Ranking 2}
%maybe this section should go in-between methodology and results? or closer to 
%the top of results? this is basically me trying to find an accurate symbol set to use. 
%so while i am trying to find results, the results are purely to help me design the 
%system better so i can actually GET results to read (i.e. i cant rely on these results 
%now because they're too shit).
%
%\paragraph{ranked probability}
%here are the ranked probabilities of each conversation. it is obvious with outliers 
%that something is wrong when looking at their ranked probabilities as the graph 
%tends more towards an equiprobable or uniform distribution, where the last symbols 
%gather many more pauses than they should. an example can be seen with 
%conversation 4745. Although the graph does not strictly resemble a uniform 
%distribution, I guess I should say the expectation is far different than 
%
%\paragraph{Entropy Profiles and Anomaly Plots}
%See if anomalies can be determined by using one symbol set on another type of 
%conversation (i.e. female symbol set on male conversation). 
%Might need to merge this and ranked probability.
