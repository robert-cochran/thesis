\chapter{Abstract}

In order to have an effective and efficient online speech classification system it's important to consider the speech elements that are being used to classify conversation files and any inherent limits of those speech elements. Without inherently meaningful elements of speech to use as a classifier, the classification potential is limited. Additionally, if an online system requires large amounts of time or complex analysis methods, this can limit the potential efficiency of that system. Pauses are proposed to be such an element of speech that contain meaningful information while being relatively easy to detect in an online speech classification system. This is due to pauses not requiring dependencies to draw meaningful information from such as semantic meaning, simply knowing the length of that pause is enough. Entropy based classification methods are proposed and evaluated on sex based and age based group using symbolisation based purely on the lengths of the pauses. Results proved to be effective in classifying two seperate audio files from distinct behavioural conversation groups, specifically young and middle aged speakers.
