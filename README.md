# Engineering Thesis
My final year thesis involved adding to the Calpy system which aimed to detect 
and measure pause usage in speech for the purpose of online alzheimers 
detection. The process involved using Shannon Entropy to measure the amount of 
information content delivered while someone is speaking and set thresholds when 
the information content (or novelty) began to drop, indicating a potential 
atypical speech pattern. This could later be used by a medical professional to 
aid in diagnosis or treatment.

# Code
The calpy folder contains the code used to produce the results in the thesis and
poster.
The code was built upon the original repo found which can be found here 
https://github.com/YvonneYYu/calpy.
However the dataset is not provided and will need to be downloaded from the 
databank provided in the thesis (too big to upload to github).
